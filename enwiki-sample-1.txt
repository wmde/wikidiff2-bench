'''Genetically modified food controversies''' are disputes over the use of foods and other goods derived from [[genetically modified crops]] instead of [[Plant breeding#Classical plant breeding|conventional crops]], and other uses of [[genetic engineering]] in food production. The dispute involves [[consumers]], [[farmers]], [[biotechnology|biotechnology companies]], governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations, and scientists. The key areas of controversy related to [[genetically modified food]] (GM food or GMO food) are whether such food should be labeled, the role of government regulators, the objectivity of scientific research and publication, the effect of genetically modified crops on health and the environment, the effect on pesticide resistance, the impact of such crops for farmers, and the role of the crops in feeding the world population. In addition, products derived from GMO organisms play a role in the production of ethanol fuels and pharmaceuticals.<!--referring to GMO corn to create ethanol fuels and GMO bacteria to produce medication. Will insert refs asap.-->

Specific concerns include mixing of genetically modified and non-genetically modified products in the food supply,{{R|CIEH}} effects of GMOs on the environment,{{R|CAPE|VDC}} the rigor of the regulatory process,{{R|IDEA|AMA_2012}} and consolidation of control of the food supply in companies that make and sell GMOs.{{R|CAPE}} [[Advocacy groups]] such as the [[Center for Food Safety]], [[Organic Consumers Association]], [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], and [[Greenpeace]], say risks have not been adequately identified and managed, and they have questioned the objectivity of regulatory authorities.

The safety assessment of genetically engineered food products by regulatory bodies starts with an evaluation of whether or not the food is ''[[substantial equivalence|substantially equivalent]]'' to non-genetically engineered counterparts that are already deemed fit for human consumption.{{R|ToxSoc2003|whybiotech.com}}{{R|UC-ANR8180|Kuiper_2002}} No reports of ill effects have been documented in the human population from genetically modified food.{{R|AMA|NRC_2004|Key_2008}} There is a [[scientific consensus]]{{R|Nicolia_2014|FA0_2004|Ronald_2011|But_see_also}} that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food,{{R|AAAA_2012|EC_2010|AMA_position|Library-of-Congress_2015|NAS_2016}} but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction.{{R|WHO_FAQ|Haslberger_2003|BMA_2004}} Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.{{R|PWR_2015|Marris_2001|PABE_2001|Scott_2016}} The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.{{R|LC_2015|ABA_2013|Time_2015|CFR_2001}}

==Public perception==
Consumer concerns about food quality first became prominent long before the advent of GM foods in the 1990s. [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' led to the 1906 [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], the first major US legislation on the subject.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Origin/ucm054819.htm|title = The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement| last = Swann | first = John P | name-list-format = vanc | series = FDA History - Part I|publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|access-date = 10 April 2013}}</ref> This began an enduring concern over the purity and later "naturalness" of food that evolved from a focus on sanitation to include added ingredients such as [[preservatives]] and [[flavors]] and [[sweeteners]], residues such as pesticides, the rise of [[organic food]] as a category and finally to concerns over GM food. The public came to see the latter as "unnatural" which created a reverse [[halo effect]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Maria | last = Konnikova | name-list-format = vanc | work = New Yorker | date = August 8, 2013 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/08/the-psychology-of-distrusting-gmos.html | title = The Psychology of Distrusting G.M.O.s }}</ref>

[[Religious views on genetically modified foods|Religious groups]] have raised concerns over whether genetically modified food will remain [[kosher]] or [[halal]]. In 2001 no such foods had been designated as unacceptable by Orthodox rabbis or Muslim leaders.<ref>[http://www.cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/Science/st-41.pdf Food Biotechnology in the United States: Science, Regulation, and Issues] ''Congressional Research Service: The Library of Congress'' 2001</ref> However, some Jewish groups dispute this designation.<ref>{{cite news|title=GMOs, A Global Debate: Israel a Center for Study, Kosher Concerns| first = Marlene-Aviva | last = Grunpeter | name-list-format = vanc | newspaper= Epoch Times|date=August 5, 2013|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/229556-gmos-a-global-debate-israel-a-center-for-study-kosher-concerns/}}</ref>

Environmental groups such as [[Friends of the Earth]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Genetic engineering|publisher=Friends of the Earth|url=http://www.foe.org/projects/food-and-technology/genetic-engineering}}</ref> include genetic engineering in general as an environmental and political concern.

===Reviews and polls===
A 2003 ''[[EMBO Reports]]'' article reported that the ''Public Perceptions of Agricultural Biotechnologies in Europe'' project (PABE)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/archive/pabe/|title=Public Perceptions of Agricultural Biotechnologies in Europe homepage|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref> found the public neither accepting nor rejecting GMOs. Instead, PABE found that public had "key questions" about GMOs: "Why do we need GMOs? Who benefits from their use? Who decided that they should be developed and how? Why were we not better informed about their use in our food, before their arrival on the market? Why are we not given an effective choice about whether or not to buy these products? Have potential long-term and irreversible consequences been seriously evaluated, and by whom? Do regulatory authorities have sufficient powers to effectively regulate large companies? Who wishes to develop these products? Can controls imposed by regulatory authorities be applied effectively? Who will be accountable in cases of unforeseen harm?"{{R|Marris_2001}} PABE also found that the public's scientific knowledge does not control public opinion, since scientific facts do not answer these questions.{{R|Marris_2001}} PABE also found that the public does not demand "zero risk" in GM food discussions and is "perfectly aware that their lives are full of risks that need to be counterbalanced against each other and against the potential benefits. Rather than zero risk, what they demanded was a more realistic assessment of risks by regulatory authorities and GMO producers."{{R|Marris_2001}}

===Conspiracy theories===
{{Main article|GMO conspiracy theories}}
There are various [[conspiracy theories]] related to the production and sale of [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified food]] that have been identified by some commentators such as [[Michael Shermer]].<ref name=Sheerer>{{cite web | last = Sheerer | first = Michael  | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-people-believe-in-conspiracy-theories/ | title = Why Do People Believe in Conspiracy Theories? | work = Scientific American | volume = 311 | issue = 6 | date = 2014 | pages = 94–94 }}</ref>  Generally, these conspiracy theories posit that GMOs are being knowingly and maliciously introduced into the food supply either as a means to unduly enrich agribusinesses or as a means to poison or pacify the population.

A work seeking to explore risk perception over GMOs in [[Turkey]] identified a belief among the conservative political and religious figures who were opposed to GMOs that GMOs were "a conspiracy by Jewish Multinational Companies and Israel for world domination."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Veltri GA, Suerdem AK | title = Worldviews and discursive construction of GMO-related risk perceptions in Turkey | language = en | journal = Public Understanding of Science | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–54 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23833021 | doi = 10.1177/0963662511423334 }}</ref> Additionally, a [[Latvia]]n study showed that a segment of the population believed that GMOs were part of a greater conspiracy theory to poison the population of the country.<ref>{{cite web|title = SHS Web of Conferences|url = http://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2014/07/shsconf_shw2012_00048/shsconf_shw2012_00048.html|website = www.shs-conferences.org|access-date = 2016-01-31}}</ref>

===''Alliance for Bio-Integrity v. Shalala''===
In this case, the plaintiff argued both for mandatory labeling on the basis of consumer demand, and that GMO foods should undergo the same testing requirements as food additives because they are "materially changed" and have potentially unidentified health risks. The plaintiff also alleged that the FDA did not follow the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedures Act]] in formulating and disseminating its policy on GMO's.  The federal district court rejected all of those arguments and found that the FDA's determination that GMO's are [[Generally Recognized as Safe]] was neither arbitrary nor capricious.  The court gave deference to the FDA's process on all issues, leaving future plaintiffs little legal recourse to challenge the FDA's policy on GMO's.{{R|Marden}}<ref>{{cite journal | first = Ramona | last = Bashshur | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1302_bashshur.html | title = FDA and Regulation of GMOs | work = ABA Health eSource | date = February 2013 | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 755–756 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia | url = http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/116/166/2576171/ | title = Alliance for Bio-Integrity v Shall | work = 116 F.Supp.2d 166 (D.D.C. 2000) | date = September 29, 2000 }}</ref>

===Bt maize===
{{See also|Monarch butterfly#Habitat loss due to herbicide use}}
One of the first incidents occurred in 1999, when [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] published a paper on potential toxic effects of [[Genetically modified maize|Bt maize]] on butterflies. The paper produced a public uproar and demonstrations, however by 2001 multiple follow-up studies had concluded that "the most common types of Bt maize pollen are not toxic to [[Monarch butterfly|monarch]] [[larvae]] in concentrations the insects would encounter in the fields" and that they had "brought that particular question to a close."<ref name=Waltz>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waltz E | title = GM crops: Battlefield | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7260 | pages = 27–32 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19727179 | doi = 10.1038/461027a }}</ref>

Concerned scientists began to patrol the scientific literature and react strongly, both publicly and privately, to discredit conclusions they view as flawed in order to prevent unjustified public outcry and regulatory action.{{R|Waltz}} A 2013 ''Scientific American'' article noted that a "tiny minority" of biologists have published concerns about GM food, and said that scientists who support the use of GMOs in food production are often overly dismissive of them.<ref name=FreedmanSciAm>{{cite web | first = David H. | last = Freedman | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-truth-about-genetically-modified-food | title = The Truth about Genetically Modified Food | work = Scientific American | date = August 26, 2013 | quote = Despite overwhelming evidence that GM crops are safe to eat, the debate over their use continues to rage, and in some parts of the world, it is growing ever louder. }}</ref>

===Restrictive end-user agreements===
Prior to 2010, scientists wishing to conduct research on commercial GM plants or seeds were unable to do so, because of restrictive [[end-user]] agreements. [[Cornell University|Cornell University's]] Elson Shields was the spokesperson for one group of scientists who opposed such restrictions. The group submitted a statement to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in 2009 protesting that "as a result of restrictive access, no truly independent research can be legally conducted on many critical questions regarding the technology".<ref name=Stutz>{{cite web|url= http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/wanted_gm_seeds_for_study |title= Wanted: GM Seeds for Study | first = Bruce | last = Stutz | name-list-format = vanc | date= 1 July 2010 | work = Seed Magazine | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100705131632/http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/wanted_gm_seeds_for_study | archive-date = 5 July 2010}}</ref>

A 2009 ''[[Scientific American]]'' editorial quoted a scientist who said that several studies that were initially approved by seed companies were blocked from publication when they returned "unflattering" results. While favoring protection of [[intellectual property rights]], the editors called for the restrictions to be lifted and for the EPA to require, as a condition of approval, that independent researchers have unfettered access to genetically modified products for research.<ref name=SciAm>{{cite journal | author = The editors | title = Do seed companies control GM crop research?

In December 2009, the [[American Seed Trade Association]] agreed to "allow public researchers greater freedom to study the effects of GM food crops." The companies signed blanket agreements permitting such research. This agreement left many scientists optimistic about the future,<ref>{{cite web | first = Emily | last = Waltz | name-list-format = vanc  | work = Nature Biotechnology | date = October 2010 | url = http://www.emilywaltz.com/News_briefs_10_Oct_Monsanto.pdf | title = Monsanto relaxes restrictions on sharing seeds for research }}</ref> However, some scientists still express concern as to whether this agreement has the ability to "alter what has been a research environment rife with obstruction and suspicion."{{R|Stutz}} Monsanto previously had research agreements (i.e., Academic Research Licenses) with approximately 100 universities that allowed for university scientists to conduct research on their GM products with no oversight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/unearthed-are-patents-the-problem/2014/09/28/9bd5ca90-4440-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html|title=Unearthed: Are patents the problem?|work=Washington Post|access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref>

===Reviews===
A 2011 analysis by Diels ''et al.'', reviewed 94 peer-reviewed studies pertaining to GMO safety to assess whether conflicts of interest correlated with outcomes that cast GMOs in a favorable light. They found that financial conflict of interest was not associated with study outcome (p = 0.631) while author affiliation to industry (i.e., a professional conflict of interest) was strongly associated with study outcome (p < 0.001).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Diels | first1 = Johan | first2 = Mário | last2 = Cunha | first3=Célia | last3 = Manaia | first4 = Bernardo | last4 = Sabugosa-Madeira | first5 = Margarita | last5 = Silva | name-list-format = vanc |title=Association of financial or professional conflict of interest to research outcomes on health risks or nutritional assessment studies of genetically modified products|journal=Food Policy|year=2011|volume=36|pages=197–203|doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.11.016|issue=2}}</ref> Of the 94 studies that were analyzed, 52% did not declare funding. 10% of the studies were categorized as "undetermined" with regard to professional conflict of interest. Of the 43 studies with financial or professional conflicts of interest, 28 studies were compositional studies. According to Marc Brazeau, an association between professional conflict of interest and positive study outcomes can be skewed because companies typically contract with independent researchers to perform follow-up studies only after in-house research uncovers favorable results. In-house research that uncovers negative or unfavorable results for a novel GMO is generally not further pursued.<ref>{{cite web | first = Marc | last = Braze | name-list-format = vanc | work = GMO Building Blocks | date = September 10, 2014 | title = About Those Industry Funded GMO Studies | url = http://fafdl.org/gmobb/about-those-industry-funded-gmo-studies/ }}</ref>

Most studies were performed years after the approval of the crop for human consumption. Papers were often imprecise in their descriptions of the histological results and the selection of study endpoints, and lacked necessary details about methods and results. The authors called for the development of better study guidelines for determining the long-term safety of eating GM foods.<ref name="pmid25244705">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zdziarski IM, Edwards JW, Carman JA, Haynes JI | title = GM crops and the rat digestive tract: a critical review | journal = Environment International | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 423–33 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25244705 | doi = 10.1016/j.envint.2014.08.018  }}</ref>

===Alleged data manipulation===

In 1999, Andrew Chesson of the [[Rowett Research Institute]] warned that substantial equivalence testing "could be flawed in some cases" and that current safety tests could allow harmful substances to enter the human food supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/440352.stm|title=UK GM expert calls for tougher tests|work=[[BBC]]|date=7 September 1999}}</ref> The same year Millstone, Brunner and Mayer argued that the standard was a pseudo-scientific product of politics and lobbying that was created to reassure consumers and aid biotechnology companies to reduce the time and cost of safety testing.

Kuiper examined this process further in 2002, finding that substantial equivalence does not measure absolute risks, but instead identifies differences between new and existing products. He claimed that characterizing differences is properly a starting point for a safety assessment<ref name=Kuiper_2002>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuiper HA, Kleter GA, Noteborn HP, Kok EJ | title = Substantial equivalence--an appropriate paradigm for the safety assessment of genetically modified foods? | journal = Toxicology | volume = 181-182 | issue =  | pages = 427–31 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12505347 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00488-2 }}</ref> and "the concept of substantial equivalence is an adequate tool in order to identify safety issues related to genetically modified products that have a traditional counterpart". Kuiper noted practical difficulties in applying this standard, including the fact that traditional foods contain many toxic or [[carcinogenic]] chemicals and that existing diets were never proven to be safe. This lack of knowledge re conventional food means that modified foods may differ in anti-nutrients and natural toxins that have never been identified in the original plant, possibly allowing harmful changes to be missed.{{R|Kuiper_2002}} In turn, positive modifications may also be missed. For example, corn damaged by insects often contains high levels of [[fumonisins]], carcinogenic toxins made by fungi that travel on insects' backs and that grow in the wounds of damaged corn. Studies show that most Bt corn has lower levels of fumonisins than conventional insect-damaged corn.<ref name=Ostry_2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostry V, Ovesna J, Skarkova J, Pouchova V, Ruprich J | title = A review on comparative data concerning Fusarium mycotoxins in Bt maize and non-Bt isogenic maize | journal = Mycotoxin Research | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–5 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 23605378 | doi = 10.1007/s12550-010-0056-5 }}</ref><ref name=NatlGeo>{{cite web | first = Jennifer | last = Ackerman | name-list-format = vanc | work = National Geographic magazine | date = May 2002 | url = http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/food-how-altered.html | title = Genetically Modified Foods }}</ref> Workshops and consultations organized by the OECD, WHO, and FAO have worked to acquire data and develop better understanding of conventional foods, for use in assessing GM foods.{{R|oecd.org}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/chemicalsafetyandbiosafety/biosafety-biotrack/consensusdocumentsfortheworkonharmonisationofregulatoryoversightinbiotechnology.htm |title=OECD harmonization webpage |publisher=Oecd.org |access-date=2013-05-30}}</ref>

A survey of publications comparing the intrinsic qualities of modified and conventional crop lines (examining [[genome]]s, [[proteome]]s and [[metabolome]]s) concluded that GM crops had less impact on [[gene expression]] or on protein and [[metabolite]] levels than the variability generated by conventional breeding.{{R|Ricroch_2011}}

In a 2013 review, Herman ([[Dow AgroSciences]]) and Price (FDA, retired) argued that transgenesis is less disruptive than traditional breeding techniques because the latter routinely involve more changes (mutations, deletions, insertions and rearrangements) than the relatively limited changes (often single gene) in genetic engineering. The FDA found that all of the 148 transgenic events that they evaluated to be substantially equivalent to their conventional counterparts, as have Japanese regulators for 189 submissions including combined-trait products. This equivalence was confirmed by more than 80 peer-reviewed publications. Hence, the authors argue, compositional equivalence studies uniquely required for GM food crops may no longer be justified on the basis of scientific uncertainty.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herman RA, Price WD | title = Unintended compositional changes in genetically modified (GM) crops: 20 years of research | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 61 | issue = 48 | pages = 11695–701 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23414177 | doi = 10.1021/jf400135r }}</ref>

===Allergenicity===
A well-known risk of genetic modification is the introduction of an [[allergen]]. Allergen testing is routine for products intended for food, and passing those tests is part of the regulatory requirements. Organizations such as the [[European Green Party]] and Greenpeace emphasize this risk.<ref>{{cite web | first = Drake | last = Bennett | name-list-format = vanc | url =  http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/07/our_allergies_ourselves/ | title = Our allergies, ourselves | work = Boston Globe | date =  7 May 2006 }}</ref> A 2005 review of the results from allergen testing stated that "no biotech proteins in foods have been documented to cause allergic reactions".<ref name=Lehrer_2005>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehrer SB, Bannon GA | title = Risks of allergic reactions to biotech proteins in foods: perception and reality | journal = Allergy | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 559–64 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15813800 | doi = 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00704.x }}</ref> Regulatory authorities require that new modified foods be tested for allergenicity before they are marketed.<ref>{{cite web | author = Staff | work = GMO Compass | date = February 15, 2006 | url = http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/safety/human_health/44.food_safety_evaluation_allergy_check_gmos.html | title = Food Safety Evaluation: The Allergy Check }}</ref>

GMO proponents note that because of the safety testing requirements, the risk of introducing a plant variety with a new allergen or toxin is much smaller than from traditional breeding processes, which do not require such tests. Genetic engineering can have less impact on the expression of genomes or on protein and metabolite levels than conventional breeding or (non-directed) plant mutagenesis.<ref name=Ricroch_2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ricroch AE, Bergé JB, Kuntz M | title = Evaluation of genetically engineered crops using transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling techniques | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 1752–61 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21350035 | pmc = 3091128 | doi = 10.1104/pp.111.173609 }}</ref> Toxicologists note that "conventional food is not risk-free; allergies occur with many known and even new conventional foods. For example, the [[kiwifruit|kiwi]] fruit was introduced into the U.S. and the European markets in the 1960s with no known human allergies; however, today there are people allergic to this fruit."{{R|ToxSoc2003}}

Genetic modification can also be used to remove allergens from foods, potentially reducing the risk of food allergies.<ref name=Herman_2003a>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herman EM | title = Genetically modified soybeans and food allergies | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 54 | issue = 386 | pages = 1317–9 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12709477 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erg164 }}</ref> A hypo-allergenic strain of soybean was tested in 2003 and shown to lack the major allergen that is found in the beans.<ref name=Herman_2003b>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herman EM, Helm RM, Jung R, Kinney AJ | title = Genetic modification removes an immunodominant allergen from soybean | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 132 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–43 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12746509 | pmc = 1540313 | doi = 10.1104/pp.103.021865 }}</ref> A similar approach has been tried in [[ryegrass]], which produces pollen that is a major cause of [[hay fever]]: here a fertile GM grass was produced that lacked the main pollen allergen, demonstrating that hypoallergenic grass is also possible.<ref name=Bhalla_1999>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhalla PL, Swoboda I, Singh MB | title = Antisense-mediated silencing of a gene encoding a major ryegrass pollen allergen | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 20 | pages = 11676–80 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10500236 | pmc = 18093 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.20.11676 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...9611676B }}</ref>

The development of genetically modified products found to cause allergic reactions has been halted by the companies developing them before they were brought to market. In the early 1990s, [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]] attempted to improve the nutrition content of soybeans intended for animal feed by adding a gene from the [[Brazil nut]]. Because they knew that people have allergies to nuts, Pioneer ran [[in vitro]] and skin prick allergy tests.

In 2007, Domingo's search of the [[Pubmed]] database using 12 search terms indicated that the "number of references" on the safety of GM or transgenic crops was "surprisingly limited," and he questioned whether the safety of GM food had been demonstrated.

===Human studies===
While some groups and individuals have called for more human testing of GM food,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psrast.org/aboutus.htm |title=Physicians and Scientists for Responsible Application of Science and Technology Official Website |publisher=Psrast.org |access-date=2013-05-30}}</ref> multiple obstacles complicate such studies. The [[General Accounting Office]] (in a review of FDA procedures requested by Congress) and a working group of the [[Food and Agricultural Organization|Food and Agricultural]] and [[World Health Organization|World Health]] organizations both said that long-term human studies of the effect of GM food are not feasible. The reasons included lack of a plausible [[hypothesis]] to test, lack of knowledge about the potential long-term effects of conventional foods, variability in the ways humans react to foods and that [[epidemiological]] studies were unlikely to differentiate modified from conventional foods, which come with their own suite of unhealthy characteristics.<ref>{{cite web | author = Staff | publisher = United States General Accounting Office | date = May 23, 2002 | url = http://www.gao.gov/assets/240/234718.pdf | work = GAO-02-566 | title =  Report to Congressional Requesters: Genetically Modified Foods] | pages = 30–32 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/agns/pdf/topics/ec_june2000_en.pdf | title = FAO/WHO (2000b) Safety Aspects of Genetically Modified Foods of Plant Origin. | work = Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Foods Derived from Biotechnology (Geneva, Switzerland) | date = May–June 2000 }}</ref>

In 2007, 2009, and 2011, [[Gilles-Éric Séralini]] published re-analysis studies that used data from [[Monsanto]] rat-feeding experiments for three modified maize varieties (insect-resistant [[MON 863]] and [[MON 810]] and [[glyphosate]]-resistant NK603). He concluded that the data showed liver, kidney and heart damage.<ref name=Seralini2007>{{cite journal | vauthors = Séralini GE, Cellier D, de Vendomois JS | title = New analysis of a rat feeding study with a genetically modified maize reveals signs of hepatorenal toxicity | journal = Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 596–602 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17356802 | doi = 10.1007/s00244-006-0149-5 }}</ref><ref name=Seralini2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Vendômois JS, Roullier F, Cellier D, Séralini GE | title = A comparison of the effects of three GM corn varieties on mammalian health | journal = International Journal of Biological Sciences | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 706–26 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20011136 | pmc = 2793308 | doi = 10.7150/ijbs.5.706 }}</ref><ref name=Seralini2011>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/2190-4715-23-10 |title=Genetically modified crops safety assessments: Present limits and possible improvements |year=2011 |last1=Séralini |first1=Gilles-Eric |last2=Mesnage |first2=Robin |last3=Clair |first3=Emilie |last4=Gress |first4=Steeve |last5=De Vendômois |first5=Joël |last6=Cellier |first6=Dominique  | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Environmental Sciences Europe |volume=23 |pages=10}}</ref> The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) then concluded that the differences were all within the normal range.<ref name="EFSA2007 review of Seralini 2007">{{cite web | title = Statement of the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms on the analysis of data from a 90-day rat feeding study with MON 863 maize | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141025062519/http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/753.pdf | archive-date = 25 October 2014 | dead-url = yes | url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/753.pdf | date = 25 June 2007 | publisher = European Food Safety Authority }}</ref> EFSA also stated that Séralini's statistics were faulty.<ref name="EFSA2007 Statistical Review of Seralini2007">{{cite journal |title=EFSA review of statistical analyses conducted for the assessment of the MON 863 90-day rat feeding study |journal=EFSA Journal |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages= 19r|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2007.19r}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/events/event/gmo100127-m.pdf|title= EFSA Minutes of the 55th Plenary Meeting of the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms Held on 27–28 January 2010 IN Parma, Italy, Annex 1, Vendemois et al 2009|publisher= European Food Safety Authority report|access-date=11 November 2010}}</ref><ref>EFSA Scientific Committee (2011)[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/fr/efsajournal/doc/2438.pdf EFSA guidance on conducting repeated-dose 90-day oral toxicity study in rodents on whole food/feed] ''EFSA Journal'' 2011;9(12) 2438</ref> EFSA's conclusions were supported by FSANZ,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/Review_of_Report_by_Seralini_et_al_July_2007.doc|title= Review of the report by Séralini et al., (2007): "New analysis of a rat feeding study with a genetically modified maize reveals signs of hepatorenal toxicity"|publisher= FSANZ final assessment report|access-date=11 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/scienceandeducation/factsheets/factsheets2007/updatefsanzreaffirms3622.cfm|title= FSANZ reaffirms its risk assessment of genetically modified corn MON 863|publisher= FSANZ fact sheets 2007|date= 25 July 2010|access-date=11 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/scienceandeducation/factsheets/factsheets/feedingstudiesandgmc5604.cfm |title=Feeding studies and GM corn MON863 |publisher=Food Standards Australia New Zealand |date=July 2012 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> a panel of expert toxicologists,<ref name=Doull_2007>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doull J, Gaylor D, Greim HA, Lovell DP, Lynch B, Munro IC | title = Report of an Expert Panel on the reanalysis by of a 90-day study conducted by Monsanto in support of the safety of a genetically modified corn variety (MON 863) | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 45 | issue = 11 | pages = 2073–85 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17900781 | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2007.08.033 }}</ref> and the French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee (HCB).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/acnfp9612a2|title= Opinion relating to the deposition of 15 December 2009 by the Member of Parliament, François Grosdidier, as to the conclusions of the study entitled "A comparison of the effects of three GM corn varieties on mammalian health"|publisher= English translation of French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee document|access-date=11 November 2010}}</ref>

==Environment==
Genetically modified crops are planted in fields much like regular crops. There they interact directly with organisms that feed on the crops and indirectly with other organisms in the [[food chain]]. The pollen from the plants is distributed in the environment like that of any other crop. This distribution has led to concerns over the effects of GM crops on the environment. Potential effects include [[gene flow]], pesticide resistance and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.

===Non-target organisms===
A major use of GM crops is in insect control through the expression of the ''cry'' (crystal delta-endotoxins) and ''Vip'' (vegetative insecticidal proteins) genes from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt). Such toxins could affect other insects in addition to targeted pests such as the [[European corn borer]]. Bt proteins have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the US since 1958, with no reported ill effects.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bt.ucsd.edu/bt_history.html |title=History of Bt |work= |publisher= University of California|access-date=8 February 2010}}</ref> ''Cry'' proteins selectively target [[Lepidopterans]] (moths and butterflies). As a toxic mechanism, ''cry'' proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut ([[epithelial]]) cells, resulting in their rupture. Any organism that lacks the appropriate receptors in its gut is unaffected by the ''cry'' protein, and therefore is not affected by Bt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bt corn: is it worth the risk?|url=http://www.scq.ubc.ca/bt-corn-is-it-worth-the-risk/|last1=Hall|first1=H.  | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=The Science Creative Quarterly}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorsch JA, Candas M, Griko NB, Maaty WS, Midboe EG, Vadlamudi RK, Bulla LA | title = Cry1A toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis bind specifically to a region adjacent to the membrane-proximal extracellular domain of BT-R(1) in Manduca sexta: involvement of a cadherin in the entomopathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis | journal = Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 32 | issue = 9 | pages = 1025–36 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12213239 | doi = 10.1016/S0965-1748(02)00040-1 }}</ref> Regulatory agencies assess the potential for transgenic plants to affect non-target organisms before approving their commercial release.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Romeis J, Hellmich RL, Candolfi MP, Carstens K, De Schrijver A, Gatehouse AM, Herman RA, Huesing JE, McLean MA, Raybould A, Shelton AM, Waggoner A | title = Recommendations for the design of laboratory studies on non-target arthropods for risk assessment of genetically engineered plants | journal = Transgenic Research | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–22 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20938806 | pmc = 3018611 | doi = 10.1007/s11248-010-9446-x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Romeis J, Bartsch D, Bigler F, Candolfi MP, Gielkens MM, Hartley SE, Hellmich RL, Huesing JE, Jepson PC, Layton R, Quemada H, Raybould A, Rose RI, Schiemann J, Sears MK, Shelton AM, Sweet J, Vaituzis Z, Wolt JD | title = Assessment of risk of insect-resistant transgenic crops to nontarget arthropods | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–8 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18259178 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1381 }}</ref>

===Biodiversity===
Crop genetic diversity might decrease due to the development of superior GM strains that crowd others out of the market. Indirect effects might affect other organisms. To the extent that agrochemicals impact biodiversity, modifications that increase their use, either because successful strains require them or because the accompanying development of resistance will require increased amounts of chemicals to offset increased resistance in target organisms.

===Gene flow===
Genes from a GMO may pass to another organism just like an [[endogenous]] gene. The process is known as [[outcrossing]] and can occur in any new open-pollinated crop variety. Introduced traits potentially can cross into neighboring plants of the same or closely related species through three different types of gene flow: crop-to-crop, crop-to-weedy, and crop-to-wild. In crop-to-crop, genetic information from a genetically modified crop is transferred to a non-genetically modified crop. Crop-to-weedy transfer refers to the transfer of genetically modified material to a weed, and crop-to-wild indicates transfer from a genetically modified crop to a wild, undomesticated plant and/or crop.<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = Bao-Rong | last1 = Lu | first2 = Allison A. | last2 = Snow | name-list-format = vanc | title = Gene Flow from Genetically Modified Rice and Its Environmental Consequences | journal = BioScience | volume = 55 | issue = 8 | date = 2005 | page =  669 | publisher = Academic Search Elite | doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055[0669:gffgmr]2.0.co;2}}</ref> There are concerns that the spread of genes from modified organisms to unmodified relatives could produce species of weeds resistant to herbicides<ref name=Conner>{{cite journal | vauthors = Conner AJ, Glare TR, Nap JP | title = The release of genetically modified crops into the environment.

In most countries environmental studies are required before approval of a GMO for commercial purposes, and a monitoring plan must be presented to identify unanticipated gene flow effects.

====Coexistence with conventional crops====
{{Main article|Genetically modified organism containment and escape}}

The US has no legislation governing the relationship among mixtures of farms that grow organic, conventional and GM crops. The country relies on a "complex but relaxed" combination of three federal agencies (FDA, EPA, and USDA/APHIS) and states' common law [[tort]] systems to manage coexistence.<ref>{{cite book | first = Michae l | last = Baram | name-list-format = vanc | chapter=Governance of GM Crop and Food Safety in the United States |pp=15–56 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PdlLGJ39_xQC&l|page=15}} |title=Governing Risk in GM Agriculture |editor-first1=Michael |editor-last1=Baram |editor-first2=Mathilde |editor-last2=Bourrier |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011}}</ref>{{rp|44}} The [[Secretary of Agriculture]] convened an Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture (AC21) to study coexistence and make recommendations about the issue. The members of AC21 included representatives of the biotechnology industry, the organic food industry, farming communities, the seed industry, food manufacturers, State governments, consumer and community development groups, the medical profession, and academic researchers. AC21 recommended that a study assess the potential for economic losses to US organic farmers; that any serious losses lead to a [[crop insurance]] program, an education program to ensure that organic farmers put appropriate contracts in place and that neighboring GMO farmers take appropriate containment measures.

The EU implemented regulations specifically governing co-existence and [[traceability]]. Traceability has become commonplace in the food and feed supply chains of most countries, but GMO traceability is more challenging given strict legal thresholds for unwanted mixing.

Opponents such as Jonathan Latham of the ''[[Bioscience Resource Project]]'' and [[Vandana Shiva]] treat industrial agriculture and modified crops as closely related topics, and call for agriculture to adopt practices drastically reducing disruptions to the environment.<ref>{{cite web | author = Staff | work = [[Bioscience Resource Project]] | date = April 2, 2013 | url = http://www.bioscienceresource.org/2013/04/bsr-news-jonathan-lathams-second-interview-on-talkradioeurope/ | title = BSR News: Jonathan Latham's Second Interview on Talk Radio Europe }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/can-biotech-food-cure-world-hunger/ |work=The New York Times |title=Can Biotech Food Cure World Hunger? |date=26 October 2009 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = Staff, PBS | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/harvest/interviews/rifkin.html | title = Interview with Jeremy Rifkin }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | first = Miguel A. | last = Altieri | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1998 | url = http://nature.berkeley.edu/~miguel-alt/modern_agriculture.html | title = Modern Agriculture: Ecological impacts and the possibilities for truly sustainable farming | work = Monthly Review | volume = 50 | issue = 3 }}</ref><!-- <ref>{{cite book | editor-first1 = Catherine | editor-last1 = Feuillet | editor-first2 = Gary J. | editor-last2 = Muehlbauer | series = Plant Genetics/Genomics: Crops and Models | volume = 7 | title = Genetics and genomics of the Triticeae | date = 2009 | publisher = Springer | location = London | isbn = 978-0-387-77488-6 | edition = First }}</ref>{{rp|527}}{{Failed verification|date=July 2016|reason=page 527 does not discuss environmental impact}}-->

Claimed deployment constraints to developing nations include the lack of easy access, equipment costs and [[intellectual property rights]] that hurt developing countries. The [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), an aid and research organization, was praised by the [[World Bank]] for its efforts, but the bank recommended that they shift to genetics research and productivity enhancement. Obstacles include access to patents, commercial licenses and the difficulty that developing countries have in accessing genetic resources and other intellectual property. The [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] attempted to remedy this problem, but results have been inconsistent. As a result, "orphan crops", such as [[teff]], [[millet]]s, [[cowpea]]s and indigenous plants, which are important in these countries receive little investment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2004.01.002 |title=Biotechnology in the developing world: A case for increased investments in orphan crops |year=2004 |last1=Naylor |first1=Rosamond L. |last2=Falcon |first2=Walter P. |last3=Goodman |first3=Robert M. |last4=Jahn |first4=Molly M. |last5=Sengooba |first5=Theresa |last6=Tefera |first6=Hailu |last7=Nelson |first7=Rebecca J.  | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Food Policy |volume=29 |pages=15–44}}</ref>

===Yield===
US maize yields were flat until the 1930s, when the adoption of conventional hybrid seeds caused them to increase by ~.8 bushels/acre (1937-1955). Thereafter a combination of improved genetics, fertilizer and pesticide availability and mechanization raised the rate of increase to 1.9 bushels per acre per year. In the years since the advent of GM maize, the rate increased slightly to 2.0.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/yieldtrends.html | title = Historical Corn Grain Yields for Indiana and the U.S. | date = August 2012 | access-date = 1 October 2014 | website = Corny News Network | publisher = Purdue University | last = Nielsen | first = R.L. | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Average US maize yields were 174.2 bushels per acre in 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ers.usda.gov/datafiles/Feed_Grains_Yearbook_Tables/All_tables_in_one_file/fgyearbooktablesrecent.xls | title = Feed grains yearbook tables - recent|date = October 2014|access-date = 1 October 2014|website = |publisher = National Agricultural Statistics Service}}</ref>

====2014 review====
A 2014 review, concluded that GM crops' effects on farming were positive.{{R|KQMeta}} According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the [[meta-analysis]] considered all published English-language examinations of the agronomic and economic impacts between 1995 and March 2014. The study found that herbicide-tolerant crops have lower production costs, while for insect-resistant crops the reduced pesticide use was offset by higher seed prices, leaving overall production costs about the same.<ref name = "Economist_2014">{{cite news | url = http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21630961-biggest-study-so-far-finds-gm-crops-have-large-widespread-benefits-field | title = Genetically modified crops - Field research | date = 8 November 2014 | work = Economist | access-date = 1 November 2014 }}</ref>

Yields increased 9% for herbicide tolerance and 25% for insect resistance. Farmers who adopted GM crops made 69% higher profits than those who did not. The review found that GM crops help farmers in developing countries, increasing yields by 14 percentage points.{{R|Economist_2014}}

The researchers considered some studies that were not peer-reviewed, and a few that did not report sample sizes. They attempted to correct for [[publication bias]], by considering sources beyond [[academic journal]]s. The large data set allowed the study to control for potentially confounding variables such as fertiliser use. Separately, they concluded that the funding source did not influence study results.{{R|Economist_2014}}

Tillage decreased by 25–58% on herbicide-resistant soybeans. Glyphosate-resistant crops allowed farmers to plant rows closer together as they did not have to control post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.<ref name=HighPlainsJ>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/2010/aug10/aug2/0716SeedMACOAug2sr.cfm |title=Roundup Ready soybean trait patent nears expiration in 2014 |publisher=Hpj.com |access-date=2013-05-30}}</ref> Insecticide applications on Bt crops were reduced by 14–76%. 72% of farmers worldwide experienced positive economic results.

====2009 review====
In 2009, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], a group opposed to genetic engineering and cloning of food animals, summarized peer-reviewed studies on the yield contribution of GM soybeans and maize in the US.<ref name=UCS>D. Gurian-Sherman. 2009. Failure to Yield. [http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/failure-to-yield.pdf UCSUSA.org]</ref> The report concluded that other agricultural methods had made a greater contribution to national crop yield increases in recent years than genetic engineering.

====Wisconsin study====
A study unusually published as correspondence rather than as an article examined maize modified to express four traits (resistance to European corn borer, resistance to corn root worm, glyphosate tolerance and glyfosinate tolerance) singly and in combination in Wisconsin fields from 1990-2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/02/do-gmo-crops-have-lower-yields|title=Do GM Crops Really Have Higher Yields?|work=Mother Jones|access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref> The variance in yield from year to year was reduced, equivalent to a yield increase of 0.8-4.2 bushels per acre. Bushel per acre yield changes were +6.4 for European corn borer resistance, +5.76 for glufosinate tolerance, -5.98 for glyphosate tolerance and -12.22 for corn rootworm resistance. The study found interactions among the genes in multi-trait hybrid strains, such that the net effect varied from the sum of the individual effects. For example, the combination of European corn borer resistance and glufosinate tolerance increased yields by 3.13, smaller than either of the individual traits<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shi G, Chavas JP, Lauer J | title = Commercialized transgenic traits, maize productivity and yield risk | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 111–4 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23392505 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2496 }}</ref>

===Intellectual property===
Traditionally, farmers in all nations saved their own seed from year to year. However, since the early 1900s hybrid crops have been widely used in the developed world and seeds to grow these crops are purchased each year from seed producers.<ref name=test>History of Research at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Agricultural Research Service [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/timeline/corn.htm Agricultural Research Service: Improving Corn].

U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC.</ref> The offspring of the hybrid corn, while still viable, lose [[Heterosis|hybrid vigor]] (the beneficial traits of the parents). This benefit of first-generation hybrid seeds is the primary reason for not planting second-generation seed. However, for non-hybrid GM crops, such as GM soybeans, seed companies use [[Biological patents in the United States|intellectual property law]] and [[bailment|tangible property common law]], each expressed in contracts, to prevent farmers from planting saved seed. For example, Monsanto's typical [[bailment]] license (covering transfer of the seeds themselves) forbids saving seeds, and also requires purchasers to sign a separate [[patent license]] agreement.<ref>[http://www.eagleseed.com/roundup.html Eagle Seed Company, Roundup Ready Seed webpage] Has example of license language</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://thefarmerslife.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/scan_doc0004.pdf | title = Monsanto Technology Stewardship Agreement 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.syngenta-us.com/seeds/vegetables/processor_sweet_corn/Sweet_Corn_Attribute_agreement.pdf | title = Syngenta Stewardship Agreement }}</ref>

The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA){{R|AMA}} and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]{{R|AAAS}} have opposed mandatory labeling absent scientific evidence of harm. The AMA said that even voluntary labeling is [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|misleading]] unless accompanied by focused consumer education. The AAAS stated that mandatory labeling "can only serve to mislead and falsely alarm consumers".

{{quote|[Labeling] efforts are not driven by evidence that GM foods are actually dangerous. Indeed, the science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe. Rather, these initiatives are driven by a variety of factors, ranging from the persistent perception that such foods are somehow "unnatural" and potentially dangerous to the desire to gain competitive advantage by legislating attachment of a label meant to alarm. Another misconception used as a rationale for labeling is that GM crops are untested.{{R|AAAS}}}}

===Objectivity of regulatory bodies===
Groups such as the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] and [[Center for Food Safety]] that have expressed concerns about the [[FDA]]'s lack of a requirement for additional testing for GMO's, lack of required labeling and the presumption that GMO's are "[[Generally Recognized as Safe]]" (GRAS), have questioned whether the FDA is too close to companies that seek approval for their products.{{R|Marden}}

{{See also|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms#Europe}}
Until the 1990s, Europe's regulation was less strict than in the U.S.<ref name=Lynch_2001>{{cite web | vauthors = Lynch D, Vogel D | url = http://www.cfr.org/genetically-modified-organisms/regulation-gmos-europe-united-states-case-study-contemporary-european-regulatory-politics/p8688 | title = The Regulation of Gmos in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory Politics | date = 2001}}</ref> In 1998, the use of [[MON810]], a Bt expressing maize conferring resistance to the [[European corn borer]], was approved for commercial cultivation in Europe. However, in the 1990s a series of unrelated food crises created consumer apprehension about [[food safety]] in general and eroded public trust in government oversight. A [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] outbreak was the most publicized.<ref name=Pew_2005>{{cite web | work = Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology | date = December 2005 | title = U.S. vs. EU: An Examination of the Trade Issues Surrounding Genetically Modiﬁed Food | url =  http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/Biotech_USEU1205.pdf }}</ref> In 1998, a ''de facto'' moratorium led to the suspension of approvals of new GMOs in the EU pending the adoption of revised rules.

In the mid-1990s, government approval of some GMO crops in the United States precipitated public concern in Europe and led to a dramatic decrease in American exports to Europe. "Prior to 1997, corn exports to Europe represented about 4% of total US corn exports, generating about $300 million in sales....For example, before 1997, the U.S. sold about 1.75 million tons of corn annually to Spain and Portugal....But in the 1998–99 crop year, Spain bought less than a tenth of the previous year's amount and Portugal bought none at all."{{R|Pew_2005}}

In May 2003, the US and twelve other countries filed a formal complaint with the [[World Trade Organization]] that the EU was violating international trade agreements, by blocking imports of US farm products through its ban on GM food.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The countries argued that the EU's regulatory process was far too slow and its standards were unreasonable given the scientific evidence showing that the crops were safe. The case was lobbied by [[Monsanto]] and France's [[Sanofi-Aventis|Aventis]], as well as by US agricultural groups such as the [[National Corn Growers Association]]. In response, in June 2003, the [[European Parliament]] ratified a [[United Nations|U.N.]] [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety|biosafety protocol]] regulating international trade in GM food, and in July agreed to new regulations requiring labeling and traceability, as well as an opt-out provision for individual countries. The approval of new GMOs resumed in May 2004. While GMOs have been approved since then, approvals remain controversial and various countries have utilized opt-out provisions. In 2006, the World Trade Organization ruled that the pre-2004 restrictions had been violations,<ref>{{cite web | author = Staff | date = 23 May 2007 | url =  http://www.euractiv.com/en/trade/eu-gmo-ban-illegal-wto-rules/article-155197 | work = Euractive.com | title = EU GMO ban was illegal, WTO rules | access-date = 7 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds291sum_e.pdf | title = EC – Approval and Marketing of Biotech Products (Disputes DS291, 292, 293)] | publisher = World Trade Organization | access-date = 7 October 2011 }}</ref> although the ruling had little immediate effect since the moratorium had already been lifted.

Critics claimed that shipment of US food to southern Africa was more about promoting the adoption of biotech crops in the region than about hunger. The US was supplying Africa with meals and support during a food crisis they were facing in the early 2000s. However, once some of the African countries realized that these shipments contained GM maize, they rejected the shipments and stopped releasing the food that had been sent to them. Critics accused the US of "exploiting the Southern African famine as a public relations tool". The U.S. countered these comments by saying that European nations were letting millions of Africans suffer from hunger and starvation because of "irrational fears over hypothetical and unproven risks". The US had a pre-GMO policy of shipping US crops as food aid, rather than buying crops in/near the countries that needed aid.

However, safety concerns cannot, as yet, be dismissed completely on the basis of information currently available.<p>When seeking to optimise the balance between benefits and risks, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and, above all, learn from accumulating knowledge and experience. Any new technology such as genetic modification must be examined for possible benefits and risks to human health and the environment. As with all novel foods, safety assessments in relation to GM foods must be made on a case-by-case basis.<p>Members of the GM jury project were briefed on various aspects of genetic modification by a diverse group of acknowledged experts in the relevant subjects. The GM jury reached the conclusion that the sale of GM foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of GM crops should be continued. These conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit. The Jury expressed concern over the impact of GM crops on farming, the environment, food safety and other potential health effects.<p>The Royal Society review (2002) concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible, and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops, stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available GM foods cause clinical allergic manifestations. The BMA shares the view that that there is no robust evidence to prove that GM foods are unsafe but we endorse the call for further research and surveillance to provide convincing evidence of safety and benefit."}}</ref>

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants.

This means that individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and that it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods.<p>GM foods currently available on the international market have passed safety assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health. In addition, no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved. Continuous application of safety assessments based on the Codex Alimentarius principles and, where appropriate, adequate post market monitoring, should form the basis for ensuring the safety of GM foods. }}</ref>
